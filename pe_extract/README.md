# pe_extract

Tool that extracts EXE, DLL, SYS and unknown files from any given byte blob, memory dump or similar data structure.

The idea for this script is based on UsAr's PEExtract tool:

It solves a few shortcomings of the original program like:
- Multiple file scan support (e.g. for automatically created memory dumps)
- Skip likely incomplete page sized PEs (for automatically created memory dumps)
- Extraction support for signed PE files
- Proper extraction of PE files where the last section's SizeOfRawData value doesn't make the overall file size
- Support for XORed PE files
